          <h2>Home page</h2>
          <p>
            This is the first paragraph of the webpage. I hope you like the page
            structure, I took the time to really think it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the second paragraph and it is just as thrilling as the
            first. If you are still reading all of this text it's because you
            have too much time on your hands. I'm still typing this text
            because, well i don't know.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the third paragraph and it doesn't promise to be any more
            interesting than the first two paragraphs. I need to type here to
            make the page extend further. I will just keep typing to say
            jibberish as long as I need more distance. Need more distance!
